I m going to graduate from Zhejiang University, the amazing place I spent for 4 years. I will definitely miss this place and the people here in the future.

This is the repository for my capstone project.

My work is to implement the algorithms described in the paper Quantile Correlations and Quantile Autoregressive Modeling and test it with the simulated data.

Hoping my academical path and research experience never ends here.
